# Simple Feedback App - PHP Project

## About Simple Feedback App

This app is a simple `leave-a-feedback` PHP application that:

- Helps clients or customers to say something for the developer.
- Using the following technologies:
  - `PHP`
  - `MySQL`
  - `PDO`
  - `Bootstrap`

> This app is originally created by Brad Traversy, but I improved it by using more clean code, `PDO` to connect to DB, and some other small edits. Of course, documentation is mine.

## Installation and Setup

To start using this app, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the [Github](https://github.com/mahelhelou/php-simple-feedback-app) repo.
2. Create a database and get ensured that the database name is similar to the database inside `/config/db.php`.

## Folder Structure

In this simple project, and I do this for almost every project, I created a basic folder structure:

```
|-- config
	|-- db.php
|-- inc
	|-- footer.php
	|-- header.php
|-- feedback.php
|-- index.php
|-- README.md
```
